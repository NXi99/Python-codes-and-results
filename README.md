# Thesis Project: Mitigating Node Centralization in the Lightning Network

## Introduction

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the thesis titled "Mitigating Node Centralization in the Lightning Network: Analyzing High-Connectivity Nodes and Network Simulation." The thesis explores strategies to identify and mitigate node centralization in the Lightning Network (LN) using analytical modeling and simulations.

## Contents

- **Python Code**: Scripts used for data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Results**: Full results of the simulation, regression analysis, and network graph analysis.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, [Mohsen Pourpouneh], for his continuous support, guidance, and valuable insights and feedback throughout this research project.
